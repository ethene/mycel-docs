# App Updates

Mycel is actively developed. Updates bring bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features.

## Checking for Updates

### Manual Check

1. Visit [github.com/ethene/mycel-releases/releases](https://github.com/ethene/mycel-releases/releases)
2. Compare the latest version with your installed version
3. Download and install the new APK if there's an update

Your current version is shown in **Settings** > **About**.

### Automatic Updates with Obtainium

[Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) is a free app that monitors GitHub releases and notifies you of updates.

**Setup:**

1. Install Obtainium from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.imranr.obtainium.fdroid/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/releases)
2. Open Obtainium and tap **+** (Add App)
3. Enter: `https://github.com/ethene/mycel-releases`
4. Tap **Add**

Obtainium will now check for new releases and notify you when updates are available.

## Installing Updates

Updates install over your existing app - **your data is preserved**.

1. Download the new APK
2. Open it and tap **Install**
3. The update replaces the old version
4. Your contacts, messages, and settings remain intact

!!! note "Same signing key"
    Updates must be signed with the same key as your installed version. If you see "signatures do not match", you may have an unofficial version installed.

## Version Numbering

Mycel uses version numbers like `2.0.720`:

- **2** - Major version
- **0** - Minor version
- **720** - Patch/build number

Higher numbers = newer versions.

## Release Notes

Each release includes notes describing what changed. Check the [Releases page](https://github.com/ethene/mycel-releases/releases) for details on each version.

## Rollback (If Needed)

If an update causes problems:

1. Uninstall the current version (this removes your data)
2. Download the older APK from [Releases](https://github.com/ethene/mycel-releases/releases)
3. Install the older version

!!! warning "Data loss on uninstall"
    Uninstalling removes your messages and identity. Export any important data before uninstalling.
