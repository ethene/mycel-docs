# Installation

Mycel is distributed as an APK file that you install directly on your Android device.

## Quick Start (Recommended)

The easiest way to install and keep Mycel updated is via **Obtainium** - a free app that tracks GitHub releases and notifies you of updates.

### 1. Install F-Droid (App Store)

If you don't already have F-Droid:

1. Go to [f-droid.org](https://f-droid.org/) on your phone
2. Tap **Download F-Droid**
3. Open the downloaded APK and tap **Install**
4. You may need to allow installation from your browser (see [Enable Unknown Sources](#enable-unknown-sources) below)

### 2. Install Obtainium

1. Open **F-Droid**
2. Search for **Obtainium**
3. Tap **Install**

*Alternative:* [Download Obtainium from GitHub](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/releases/latest)

### 3. Add Mycel to Obtainium

1. Open Obtainium
2. Tap **+** (Add App)
3. Paste this URL: `https://github.com/ethene/mycel-releases`
4. Tap **Add**
5. Tap **Install** when prompted

That's it! Obtainium will download and install Mycel, and notify you of future updates.
