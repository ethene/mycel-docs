# Installation

Mycel is distributed as an APK file that you install directly on your Android device.

!!! info "Why not the Play Store?"
    Mycel is designed for situations where you may not have internet access. The Play Store requires an active connection and Google account, which conflicts with our goal of working completely offline. Sideloading the APK ensures you can install Mycel anywhere, anytime.

## Quick Start (Recommended)

The easiest way to install and keep Mycel updated:

1. **F-Droid** - A trusted open-source app store (like Play Store, but community-run)
2. **Obtainium** - An update manager that notifies you when new Mycel versions are released

### 1. Install F-Droid (App Store)

[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) is a trusted catalog of open-source Android apps. If you don't already have it:

1. Go to [f-droid.org](https://f-droid.org/) on your phone
2. Tap **Download F-Droid**
3. Open the downloaded APK and tap **Install**
4. You may need to allow installation from your browser (see [Enable Unknown Sources](#enable-unknown-sources) below)

### 2. Install Obtainium

[Obtainium](https://obtainium.imranr.dev/) tracks app releases on GitHub and notifies you when updates are available - no app store required.

1. Open **F-Droid**
2. Search for **Obtainium**
3. Tap **Install**

*Alternative:* [Download from GitHub](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/releases/latest) if you prefer not to use F-Droid

### 3. Add Mycel to Obtainium

[![Get it on Obtainium](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/main/assets/graphics/badge_obtainium.png)](https://apps.obtainium.imranr.dev/redirect.html?r=obtainium://add/https://github.com/ethene/mycel-releases)

**Tap the badge above** to add Mycel automatically, or manually:

1. Open Obtainium
2. Tap **+** (Add App)
3. Paste: `https://github.com/ethene/mycel-releases`
4. Tap **Add** → **Install**

That's it! Obtainium will notify you of future updates.
